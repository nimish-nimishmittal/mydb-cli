# MyDB CLI & Studio

MyDB is a Python-based MySQL management tool with branching functionality. It enables database branching, migration management, and a graphical interface for managing database structures and migrations using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Database Branching**: Create, switch, and delete branches of your database, enabling separate development environments within the same MySQL instance.
- **Table Management**: Create, list, describe, and drop tables in each branch.
- **Migration System**: Define, apply, and rollback schema migrations for each branch.
- **Streamlit GUI**: MyDB Studio provides a graphical interface with visual tools for branch and migration management, and a SQL assistant with Google Gemini integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- MySQL Database
- Required Python libraries (install with `pip`):
  ```bash
  pip install click mysql-connector-python streamlit pandas plotly networkx google-generative-ai
  ```

## Configuration

- Set up your database credentials in config.json under .mydb directory. The file will look like this by default:

```bash
{
  "connection": {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "B#@w@+123",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "mydb",
    "auth_plugin": "mysql_native_password"
  },
  "current_branch": "main",
  "branches": {
    "main": {
      "created_at": "2023-11-08T10:00:00",
      "last_accessed": "2023-11-08T10:00:00"
    }
  }
}

```
